These sessions are best for resolving immediate concerns, clarifying policies, or getting quick guidance without the need for an appointment.Virtual drop-in advising operates on a first-come, first-served basis. Use the link below to join a virtual drop-in academic advising session. Once you have joined the Zoom session, complete the linked check-in form to meet with a member of the GWSB academic advising team.  Virtual Drop-in Advising Schedule for Fall 2025Mondays:  9:00 AM - 11:00 AM ETThursdays:  2:00 PM - 4:00 PM ETNote: Students must be signed in 15 minutes prior to the end of the scheduled drop-in advising timeframe in order to be seen.Drop-in advising dates and times are subject to change. Students are encouraged to consult the website regularly for the most current schedule. The advising office will make every effort to provide a minimum of one weekâs notice in the event of any adjustments.Join - https://gwu-edu.zoom.us/j/98318408502#successScheduled Academic Advising AppointmentsFor more in-depth academic discussions, students can schedule a 30-minute advising appointment, available both in-person and virtually. These appointments are ideal for multi-semester academic planning, exploring majors, minors, or concentrations, and preparing for study abroad programs.Students can schedule appointments up to two weeks in advance, with new time slots released every business day. If no appointments are available, check back regularly, as new openings may become available due to cancellations.No-Show Appointment Policy Advising appointments are limited, so we ask that you cancel at least one business day in advance if you are unable to attend. Same-day cancellations or missed appointments will be recorded as a &quot;no-show.&quot; Students who accumulate three no-shows in a semester will lose the ability to schedule advising appointments for the remainder of that term. However, they may still access virtual drop-in advising sessions.  Thank you for your cooperation in ensuring advising availability for all students.Summer AvailabilityAdvising appointments are offered virtually and in-person during the summer. If you are in the DC area and would like your 30-minute appointment to be in-person, please email an academic advisor to see if they are available to meet in-person.

the Advising Center experiences increased traffic, such as add/drop period at the start of the semester and the weeks leading up to registration, the Advising Center will hold extended drop-in hours to accommodate more students. We encourage you to utilize the extended drop-in hours as appointments may be limited.What is DegreeMAP and why should I use it?DegreeMAP is GWâs online advising tool for use by students and their advisors to track progress toward degree completion. Information on the DegreeMAP tool can be found here.What is the GW Bulletin?The GW Bulletin covers GW's undergraduate and graduate degree programs and courses for all the schools at GW, with the regulations that pertain to academic programs. It also contains institutional information as well as updated and expanded information on all GW schools, departments, and programs. You can find a complete list of courses offered at GW in the Bulletin, including a brief description of the course, the number of credit hours earned for completing the course, and course prerequisites. Only courses listed in the Schedule of Classes are offered in the upcoming semester, and some courses may not be offered every semester or even year.When and how do I declare my concentration/major/minor?Students are encouraged to declare a concentration or major and minor by the spring semester of sophomore year, so that they have a full understanding of their degree requirements. Students are welcome to declare these during their first-year at GW if they know what they want to study.GWSB students can declare their major or concentration by emailing a GWSB Advisor. To declare a minor or second major outside of GWSB, students will work with the faculty advisor in the corresponding department to complete a Minor/Second Major Declaration Form to be uploaded to the Academic Forms page.If you have questions or concerns about your curriculum, speak to an advisor.How do I know which classes I should take each semester?This answer varies by student, depending on your degree plans and the credit you have earned so far at GW. Students are responsible for utilizing academic advising and other available resources to map out their course registration plans. Read our Student Responsibilities page for more about how to take advantage of the resources available to you in order to optimize each semester of academic study.How many credits should I take each semester?Full-time tuition covers 12 - 18 credits in the fall and spring semesters. Full-time students generally take five classes per semester (roughly 15-16 credits) in order to stay on track to graduate in four years.Taking fewer than 12 credits makes you a part-time student, which carries various implications. Please discuss this with an advisor ahead of time.Taking more than 18 credits means you will pay extra tuition, and you would be shouldering a very heavy course load.

the Advising Center before the end of the eighth week of the semester.How do waitlists work?Most courses throughout GW utilize a Waitlist. This means that if a course is closed, students may place themselves on the waitlist. When a student drops the course, that seat becomes available to the student at the top of the waitlist. If you are offered a seat, you will receive an email from the Registrar Office. You must claim your seat within 24 hours, or your seat will be offered to the next person on the waitlist and you will be dropped from the waitlist.Complete information on how waitlists for courses work can be found on the Registrarâs website here. Professors cannot override the waitlist.  If a course is waitlisted, studentsâ only option is to register for a spot on the waitlist; talking with the professor will not by-pass the list.You may only be enrolled in one section of a course at a time. This applies to both open and waitlisted sections. If you would like to switch sections of a course, you must first drop yourself from the section in which you are currently enrolled or waitlisted, and then add the CRN of the other section. For example: If you are registered for BADM 3501 Section 10, but would prefer to be on the waitlist of BADM 3501 Section 11, you must first drop BADM 3501 Section 10, then add to the waitlist for BADM 3501 Section 11. Receiving a spot off the waitlist is not guaranteed and we recommend you enroll in an open section of a course. If adding yourself to the waitlist for a course be sure to register for an open course as a backup. How long do I have to decide about adding, dropping, or withdrawing from a class?Complete information about these deadlines can be found on the Registrarâs website here. Students are responsible for being aware of these deadlines during each academic term.Courses dropped beginning the first day of classes are subject to the university refund schedule, which governs the prorated cancellation of semester tuition charges in cases of program adjustment or withdrawal. The full refund schedule can be found here.What is the difference between Drop and Withdrawal?Drop: Courses may be dropped with no record on a studentâs transcript between the registration period and the end of the 4th week of the spring or fall semester.  Students only have the 1st week of summer classes to drop a class. In both cases, students will be subject to the Refund schedule.Withdrawal: After the 4th week of the semester, students may withdraw from a course. This occurs starting the 2nd week for summer courses. Students will earn a âWâ on their transcript after removing themselves from a class, which does not have an impact on the student's GPA.  Students can withdraw from a course via GWeb until the end of the 10th week.Undergraduate students in CCAS, GWSB, SEAS, ESIA and GWSPH may withdraw from an undergraduate course through the last day of classes in the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course.

who wish to withdraw must complete an RTF and submit it to their advising office. No supporting documentation is required for this action to be considered. This policy does not apply to undergraduates who are taking courses in any school other than the ones listed above, nor does it apply to students taking any graduate course.What is the difference between an RTF and an RTF-EZ?Please refer to The Office of the Registrar to find out which would be the most appropriate registration form for you to use.How much time should I leave between classes?You should allow a minimum of 10 minutes between classes on the Foggy Bottom campus and a minimum of 40 minutes between classes if you will be traveling between the Foggy Bottom and Mt. Vernon campuses.What does a balanced schedule look like?Full-time tuition covers 12-18 credits in the fall and spring semesters. Full-time students generally take five 3-credit courses per semester (roughly 15-17 credits) in order to stay on track to graduate within four years. Anything over 18 credits will incur additional tuition expenses.Taking fewer than 12 credits makes you a part-time student. Select a balanced set of courses. Be sure to balance your schedule so that it includes both qualitative (humanities/electives/science/etc.) and quantitative (math/economics/accounting/etc.) courses. We recommend that you take no more than two quantitative courses during your first semester at GW. Which UW 1020 section should I register for?UW 1020 has a number of sections that focus on different topic areas. Choose a section where the topic sounds interesting to you, but be flexible as your top choice section may be closed. You can see the topics for each UW 1020 section in the comments section of the Schedule of Classes. What happens if I have a hold on my account?Before each registration, you should check to make certain that you do not have any holds on your record. You can do this on GWeb by clicking &quot;Student Records &amp; Registration&quot; - &quot;Student Records Information&quot;- &quot;View Administrative Holds.&quot; Holds will prevent you from registering, adding or dropping classes, ordering transcripts, obtaining grades, or graduating. They are placed on student accounts for various reasons, such as: money due to the university; the need to meet with an advisor; unmet immunization requirements; etc. A hold can only be lifted by the office that placed it. The hold screen will tell you the office that placed the hold and many will include the contact number. You must contact that office for assistance. All freshmen will have a hold placed on their account by the GWSB Advising Center prior to their first spring registration. To have your hold removed, simply meet with an advisor in the fall semester to plan your spring semester courses.

The full schedule for the Vern Express to Mount Vernon Campus can be found here.International Summer CourseworkCan I complete summer coursework internationally?Students can complete summer coursework internationally in one of two ways. First, students can explore approved Study Abroad programs offered by GW through GW Passport. Courses constituting summer Study Abroad must meet the following qualities:Admission to the program is via GW PassportProgram costs and tuition are billed through GW and appear on the studentâs accountAll other coursework completed internationally over the summer is considered international study, and is subject to the same restrictions and approval process as domestic transfer credit.To better understand the difference between Study Abroad and International Study Away, please visit the GW Global Study page.How do I find GW Study Abroad summer programs?GW Passport lists all approved summer Study Abroad programs available to GW students. GWSB students may be particularly interested in the short-term abroad programs offered by the Office of Global and Experiential Education in GWSB.What is the process to take a course internationally away from GW?International Study courses (non-Study Abroad international courses) go through the same approval process as domestic transfer credit. For complete information on the Universityâs policies regarding transfer credit, refer to the information provided on the Registrarâs website. Please note that approval of transfer credit by GWSB is contingent upon the University regulations and all residency requirements as outlined in the University Bulletin. Approval is NOT guaranteed and should be obtained prior to enrolling in a course elsewhere.Courses taken through approved GW Study Abroad programs will be submitted through the GW CATS system. Please visit the Office for Study Abroad to learn how to transfer credit back to GW.Records and Student Status How do I order an official transcript?Official transcripts are issued by the Registrarâs Office.

section, you will be enrolled. If you do not meet the requirements or if the section is full then GWSB Undergraduate Programs will reach out to you.BADM 4001: InternshipsThis section is for GWSB students who have been offered an eligible internship or job for the semester in which they will enroll in this course.Semesters Offered: Fall, Spring, SummerThe Summer Internship section of BADM 4001 occurs over both summer course sessions (14 weeks total).Meeting Day/Time: Please reference the GW Schedule of Classes for the meeting day/time/location.Who is Eligible: Students who are offered an internship/job for the semester they wish to enroll in BADM 4001. For BADM 4001, the term âinternshipâ is defined as an employment opportunity in which a student works in one role for a minimum of 70 hours total in the academic semester that they are requesting to enroll in BADM 4001. The internship/job should provide significant opportunities for students to gain practical experience that complements their academic learning. Examples of internships include paid and non-paid employment opportunities off-campus as well as on-campus employment through the GW Office of Student Employment. Important Note: this section must be taken in a separate semester if the student is enrolled in TSTD 4102: Practicum.It is the studentâs responsibility to search for their own internship and complete all necessary steps for their internship search process. It is important to plan accordingly. We strongly recommend starting the internship search at least 3-4 months in advance of the academic semester. Some internship recruitment cycles even start 9-12 months in advance.Students can search for internships on their own or through the GW Handshake website. Students may also search for on-campus jobs through the GW Student Employment website.Students who need assistance with the internship search should meet with a staff member from the F. David Fowler Career Center.While the studentâs internship should be during the semester in which they wish to enroll in BADM 4001, the internship does not need to span the entire length of the course as long as all course expectations are met.Registration Process:Step 1: Review the eligibility requirements for this section and secure an approved internship to ensure you meet all requirements before submitting your registration request.Step 2: Once an internship position has been secured, the student must complete the BADM 4001 Internship Agreement Form (PDF) with their supervisor and submit the Internship Agreement Form with their internship/job offer letter through the BADM 4001 Registration Request Form.Be sure to review the Internship Agreement Form in its entirety.
